              Sometimes it's useful to initialize processes in your pipeline by
              wrapping them in a function. In here, we're connecting to a
              database, and then initializing a server with Apollo. We also
              compute the context for resolvers depending on whether the user is
              authenticated or not; that logic, however, is abstracted somewhere
              else. I enjoy the declarative style of calling a{" "}
              <code>launchSpidersServer</code> function in the end, akin to
              turning the key in your car.

async function launchSpidersServer(
  database: SpidersDatabase,
  { typeDefs, resolvers, auth, utils: { computeContext } }: GraphQL.Layer) {
  
  await database.connect();

  const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers: resolvers,
    async context({ req }) {
      return await computeContext(req, database, auth);
    },
  });

  server.listen({ port: 9991 }).then(() => {
    console.log(\`ðŸš€ Apollo Server launched @ \${graphqlServerUri}\`);
  });

              I think of my internal services as uniform APIs. With Typescript,
              the tools to design interfaces that communicate seamlessly with
              each other are there. For each layer of my stackâ€”from the
              database, to the middle end GraphQL (including authentication
              middleware) we create API layers which expose methods and helpers
              related in funcionality with one another.
